# Prodigy API Wrapper In Python

Prodigy is a Math Game.
Like all math games someone has to hack it.

[PMGH](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking) hacked prodigy.
They did a good job, but they focused on hacking the game while I am focusing on hacking the api.
So in this python package I hacked the api.
Some of this came from PMGH but this put's it into a module so it's more usable.

You can also use [this repo](https://github.com/ProdigyAPI/ProdigyAPIDocs).
It cover's some other endpoints and gives JavaScript and Python code and will give config files for Thunder Client and Postman.

This repository contains wrappers for prodigy's api in multiple languages.
So far we have:

- [Python](python/index.md)
- [JavaScript](javascript/index.md)
