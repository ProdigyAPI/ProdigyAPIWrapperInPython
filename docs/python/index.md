# Python

This is the python version of the module.

## Installing

This module requires python 3.8 and higher.

**I have only tested it with 3.9 but it should work with 3.8 and 3.10. Please let me know if it does not.**

Like all python packages, you need pip.

You can download it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Now for installing the module.

You can install the module with this:

```shell
pip3 install prodigy-api
```

## Functions

This module contains these functions:

- [tokenify](tokenify.md)
- [player](player.md)
- [update_player](update_player.md)
- [gameData](gameData.md)
- [gameStatus](gameStatus.md)
- [get_asset](get_asset.md)

Most of the functions accept a log option which you can pass by adding ``log = True`` as a keyword.

If the function does not allow it, it will be said in that function's documentation.
